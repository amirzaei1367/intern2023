Hardcoded AWS Access Credentials:

    Issue: The AWS credentials are hardcoded.
    Potential Attack: Unauthorized AWS access.
    Recommendation: Use IAM roles or store credentials in environment variables.

Unrestricted File Types & Data Input and Validation:

    Issue: Unchecked file uploads of various types.
    Potential Attack: Malicious file uploads and file-based attacks.
    Recommendation: Validate file contents, integrate malware scanning, and sanitize content.

Static Seed Initialization:

    Issue: Predictable seed for randomization.
    Recommendation: Use dynamic seeding.

Unsecured External Service Call & External Service Calls:

    Issue: Unencrypted and unauthenticated external POST request.
    Potential Attack: Data interception, service failures, and DNS rebinding.
    Recommendation: Use HTTPS, validate certificates, and avoid hardcoding IPs.

Potential Path Traversal Vulnerability:

    Issue: Unvalidated user input for file paths.
    Potential Attack: Directory traversal.
    Recommendation: Validate and sanitize user inputs.

Error Handling & Error Handling:

    Issue: Insufficient error handling.
    Potential Attack: Information disclosure.
    Recommendation: Implement robust error handling without exposing details.

Static S3 Bucket Name:

    Issue: Hardcoded S3 bucket name.
    Recommendation: Use secure configuration management.

Appending to CSV without Verification:

    Issue: Unverified data appended to CSV.
    Potential Attack: Data corruption/injection.
    Recommendation: Validate and sanitize data before appending.

Inefficient S3 Uploads:

    Issue: Repeated S3 uploads.
    Recommendation: Opt for batch uploads or more efficient mechanisms.

Potential Denial of Service (DoS) Attack Vector & Service Availability:

    Issue: Potential for DoS attacks.
    Recommendation: Implement rate-limiting and file size checks.

Print Statements:

    Issue: Data leakage via print statements.
    Recommendation: Limit print statements in production and use secure logging.

Data Storage and Handling:

    Issue: Unencrypted data storage.
    Recommendation: Encrypt data and avoid predictable filenames.

Regular Expressions:

    Issue: Potential ReDoS through regex.
    Recommendation: Ensure safe regex patterns.

Code Complexity and Maintainability:

    Issue: Complex methods.
    Recommendation: Refactor into smaller, focused functions.

Static Files:

    Issue: Unchecked reference to specific files.
    Recommendation: Validate file presence and integrity.

JSON Handling:

    Issue: Unvalidated JSON input from query parameters.
    Recommendation: Validate JSON and use POST over GET for large data.

Dependencies:

    Issue: Potential outdated/vulnerable libraries.
    Recommendation: Regularly update and check for vulnerabilities.

Authentication and Authorization:

    Issue: Lack of authentication/authorization checks.
    Recommendation: Implement standard authentication and authorization methods.
